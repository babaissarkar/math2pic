# Introduction
`ss_tex2jpg` -- A shell script to convert an input .tex file to a .jpg picture, using the method described [here](https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/34054/tex-to-image-over-command-line).  
`ss_math2pic.pl` -- A Perl script that scans an input plain-text document for TeX mathmode equations inside $$, extracts and converts them to jpg picture files and creates a copy of the original file with all equations replaced by links to corresponding image files. Requires `ss_tex2jpg` to be present on the system.
	
# Usage
`ss_tex2jpg input.tex`  
`ss_math2pic.pl input.txt`
	
# Dependencies
1. Bash shell
2. Perl
3. A LaTeX installation with the `xelatex` command and the `standalone` package, preferably the latest version.
4. Understanding of Markdown and LaTeX (and probably HTML).
	
# Installation and configuration
1. Put `ss_tex2jpg` and `ss_math2pic.pl` inside a directory that's included in your `PATH` variable. (For Linux systems, it is usually `/usr/local/bin`).
2. Put `eqn_sample.tex` in `~/Templates`.
3. Now you are done!
	
# Try it out!
## ss_tex2jpg
1. First install everything and put the the `examples` directory somewhere in your system.
2. Open a terminal and `cd` inside the examples folder.
3. Look at the contents of `example1.tex` and read the next section. It contains a equation inside

	\begin{math}
	...
	\end{math}
	
4. Run `ss_tex2jpg example1.tex`.
5. You'll get a nice jpg file called `example1.jpg` of the equation written in LaTeX math mode macro inside `example1.tex`.

## ss_math2pic.pl
6. Now run `ss_math2pic` on `example2.txt`. It will extract the mathematical formulae written inside $$, parse it using `xelatex` and will use the `standalone` package to generate a picture of the equation (inside a file called `out0.jpg`). It will also generate a new file named `example2-gen.txt` which has $...$ part replaced by a html `<img>` tag pointing to the generated image.
7. You can then parse `example2-gen.txt` with markdown to generate a html page, with all equation macros replaced by beautiful images generated by LaTeX!
8. A copy of all generated outputs from the examples are given in the `examples/out` directory.


# Very important...
If you are already familer with LaTeX, you might notice the absence of the following in `example1.tex` :

	\documentclass{article}
	...
	\begin{document}
	...
	\end{document}

To simplify things for you, I have already written this inside `eqn_sample.tex`. You just need to write your equation in `input.tex`

	\begin{math}
		$x^2 - 3x + 2 = 0$
	\end{math}

`input.tex` file will be included inside the `eqn_sample.tex` file using the LaTeX macro `\input{}`, so don't bother with it. Don't believe me, go ahead and open up `eqn_sample.tex`. You will understand.
